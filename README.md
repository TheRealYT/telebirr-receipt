# telebirr-receipt

### What is telebirr-receipt

`telebirr-receipt` Is a small nodejs package to parse and verify
telebirr transaction receipt. Any telebirr transaction
receipt can be found through the url
`https://transactioninfo.ethiotelecom.et/receipt/{receipt_no}`
by replacing `{receipt_no}` with receipt number or id which is sent from telebirr
transaction SMS or the full receipt url is also sent via SMS.

### How to install

```
npm install telebirr-receipt
```

### Basic usage

#### Loading receipt from url

```javascript
const {receipt, utils: {loadReceipt, parseFromHTML}} = require('telebirr-receipt')

// use it with caution / security warning
process.env['NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED'] = 0

// TODO: replace `receiptNo`
loadReceipt({receiptNo: 'ADQ...'}).then(htmlAsString => {
    const {verify, verifyOnly, verifyAll, equals} = receipt(parseFromHTML(htmlAsString), {to: 'Someone'})
    verify((parsedFields, preDefinedFields) => {
        // do anything with receipt
    })
}).catch(reason => {
    console.error(reason)
}).finally(() => {
    process.env['NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED'] = 1
})
```

#### Using custom receipt parser with custom string source

```javascript
const {receipt} = require('telebirr-receipt');

function parse() {
    const source = 'payer_name=Abebe;amount=5000;to=Kebede'
    const result = {};

    source.split(';').forEach(pair => {
        const field = pair.split('=');
        result[field[0]] = field[1];
    });

    return result;
}

const {verifyAll, verify, equals} = receipt(parse(), {to: 'Kebede', amount: '5000'})

// match expected receiver's name with the name found on receipt
console.log(verify((parsedInfo, myInfo) => equals(parsedInfo?.to, myInfo?.to))) // match any field

console.log(verifyAll(['payer_name'])) // match every field but `payer_name`
```

### Use case

The main use case of this project is to overcome payment api unavailability and requirements in Ethiopia. Based on this
project you can get paid and verify your payment transactions.

1. Your customers may fill their personal or payment information
2. Your customers pay you via telebirr
3. You let your customers know how to verify their payment by entering their transaction number or link which is
   received from 127 / telebirr SMS.
4. So you can verify that who send the money to you.

### IMPORTANT

The telebirr receipt website may be modified or changed at anytime, so it is important to test HTML parser every time
before letting users pay and before verifying.
You could test the parser simply by hard coding a sample transaction information manually and matching it with parsed
from url.

### Known issues

1. `loadReceipt` fails with error: `unable to verify the first certificate`, code: `UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE`.
   Disabling certificate verification could fix the problem, but it is not recommended.
   Let me know if there is good solution to this problem.
2. `parseFromHTML` may return different receipt field values or even empty and omit field values because of
   the variability of the receipt website based on transaction such as transferring to bank and direct telebirr
   transferring have different receipt format and soon. Thus, you should take a look at the return data of the
   function `parseFromHTML` for different transaction destinations.
